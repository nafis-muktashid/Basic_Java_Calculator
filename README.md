# Basic_Java_Calculator



Java Simple Project
Made with Java as a University course task.



This calculator can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and has an ON/OFF switch at this point. Hopefully wold add some more featurs.
Primarily made with Neatbeans with JFrame that allows devlopers to drag and drop the buttons and all. Keep in mind that the functionalities has to be developed and implemented by devloper himself.. 

Thanks.
